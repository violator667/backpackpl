# backpackpl

[![Total Downloads][ico-downloads]][link-downloads]

This is a package that ads polish translation to your FRESH [Laravel-Backpack](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/) installation.

It's important to do it on a FRESH installation because it publishes (overwrites) Backpack views (ex. list.blade.php).

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require violator667/backpackpl
```

## Usage
``` bash
$ php artisan backpackpl:addpolish
```
